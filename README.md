# World Clock Widget Generator

[中文](chinese.md) [日本語](japanese.md)  

This project is used to generate the World Clock Widget, which can show local times of different places one by one, and handle Daylight Saving Time (DST) automatically.

This widget is suitable for live-streamers whose audiences are from all over the world.

## How to Use

Go to [this site](https://yanjisheng.github.io/worldclock), and follow the instructions.

Alternatively, you can also download the file <code>generator-en.html</code>, and open it in a web browser to use.

## How to Contribute

You can fork this project, and give pull requests to me. I need <code>generator-xx.html</code> in more languages, such as Spanish, French, German, and so on. However, I only understand Chinese, English and Japanese, so I need your help. 

When you edit your <code>generator-xx.html</code> file, please change all the texts, especially tip messages that only appear when your mouse is hovering on something or when an error happened. If you're not sure, you can see the differences between <code>generator-en.html</code> and <code>generator-zh.html</code> to find texts you need to change. Additionally, take care of the date and time format in you language, which may be different from that in English.

# World Clock Widget

[中文](chinese.md)

This widget shows times and dates from all over the world. It uses timezone data embedded in web browsers with no extra dependents needed, and can automatically handle daylight saving time (DST).

This widget can be very useful for live streamers whose audiences are from all over the world.

## How to use

Just download the file `worldclock.html`, and add it by OBS - Source - Browser, check "local file", and then choose the downloaded file. The procedure is the same as any other widgets.

## Want to change something?

To change color, appearance, time or date format, or behavior, just edit the file as you like. There are comments to help you. 

If you want to add a new timezone, please notice that `ianaTimezone` means the standard timezones issued by International Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). [Click here](https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tzdb/zone1970.tab) to find the newest full list of IANA timezones. If something wrong with a certian timezone, check the spellings first, then upgrade your browser.
